### Discussion questions


- What's the difference between null and undefined?
 - Undefined is a primitive (type itself; every undefined is the same as every other) and means no value has been assigned
 - Null is an object (typeof null = [object]), and has to be assigned
- What is a value? What is an expression? What is a statement?
 - A value is an expression that can't be evaluated further (1 + 2 can be evaluted to 3)
 - An expression is a JavaScript statement or value
 - A statement is an individual Javascript command to be evaluated
- What are the different parts of a function?
 - Functions represent computations to be performed. The simplest function is function() {}
 - Function is a reference type - each instance of a function has its own 'reference' or identity
 - Functions have arguments and a body of statements. One important statement is the return value
- What is the difference between call-by-value and call-by-sharing?
 - call-by-value: when you write a function that works on an expression, JS evaluates the expressions before giving the statement to the function
 - call-by-sharing: this is to do with reference types, which refer to the exact same (serial number) variable. when a function works on a reference type it passes the reference location
- What is function scope?
 - Scope refers to how variables are available in functions
- What is a free variable?
 - A 'free variable' is a variable that is not bound within the function. Typically we bind variables in functions by passing in an argument with the same name. 
- What is the difference between a function and a closure?
 - A 'pure function' has no free variables; a _closure_ contains one or more free variables
- How are values evaluated in lexical scoping?
 - Inner functions contain the scope of outer functions
- What is global scope?
 - JS creates a default environment with some useful libraries. In browsers the window is the global, as I understand it
- What are two ways to name a variable?
 - var Pi = 3.14159265;
 - or by just assigning a value Pi = 3.14159265;

- What is the difference between binding a function to a variable, naming a function, and declaring a function?
- What are the two types of higher order functions? What's the difference between them?
- What is `this`? How does it behave differently between methods and functions?
- What is `arguments`?


"If pure functions can contain closures..." I don't quite get this exercise


### Exercises

- Write a function that will calculate the [fibonacci sequence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) to a requested term, using only functions (no looping constructs) with recursion.
- Write a function that adds a variable defined in the global scope to a variable defined in parent scope to a variable defined in local scope, using partial application.
- Write a function decorator that takes two arrays them to the decorated function as a single plain old javascript object.
- Write a function decorator that concatenates the items of a function that returns a list of strings.
- Create a function that takes a list of numbers and returns a function that takes a single number and returns the original list with each item multiplied by the number.
- Write a function based on variadic that manipulates elements in the DOM
- Write a function that retrieves something from Local Storage and `tap` it two different ways.
- Attach an event handler to an element and trigger it.
